# 📦 Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) — Storage Services  

## 🌍 1. Introduction  
Storage is a foundational component of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). It ensures persistence, scalability, and flexibility for a wide range of workloads. OCI provides **three primary storage services** that certification candidates must clearly understand:  

1. **Block Volumes**  
2. **File Storage**  
3. **Object Storage**

## 🔹 2. Block Volume Service  

### 📌 Definition  
- A **Block Volume** is a virtual disk attached to a compute instance.  
- Functions like a physical hard drive for storing OS images, applications, or persistent data.  

### ✨ Key Features  
- **Persistence**: Data remains intact even if the compute instance is deleted.  
- **Attach/Detach Flexibility**:  
  - Can attach a block volume to a VM.  
  - Detach it later without losing data.  
  - Reuse it by attaching to another VM.  
- **Storage Method**: Data is managed in **blocks**, ensuring reliable and efficient I/O operations.  

### 📖 Use Case  
- Ideal for workloads that require **dedicated storage** tied to a single compute instance.  

---

## 🔹 3. File Storage Service  

### 📌 Definition  
- A **shared storage service** accessible by multiple compute instances.  
- Works like a **network drive** that can be mounted across VMs, bare metal servers, or containers.  

### ✨ Key Features  
- **File-Based Management**: Data is stored and managed as files (not blocks).  
- **Shared Access**: Multiple users and compute nodes can connect simultaneously.  
- **Advanced Capabilities**: Optimized for microservices, big data, and analytics workloads.  

### 📖 Use Case  
- Collaborative applications that require **shared access** to data, such as analytics pipelines or distributed applications.

## 🔹 4. Object Storage Service  

### 📌 Definition  
- Provides **internet-scale, high-performance storage** for unstructured data.  
- Data is stored as **objects** within **buckets**.  

### ✨ Key Features  
- **Global Accessibility**: Accessible from anywhere (including browsers and APIs).  
- **Unstructured Data Storage**: Supports images, videos, logs, backups, and mobile/web app assets.  
- **Durability & Reliability**: Offers strong data protection and cost-efficient options for long-term storage.  
- **Buckets**: Logical containers (similar to folders) that organize objects and support lifecycle management policies.  

### 📖 Use Case  
- Storing **application assets, multimedia, and backups** with scalable access requirements.

## ✅ 5. Exam-Ready Summary  

| Storage Type       | Data Format | Accessibility | Key Use Case |
|--------------------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Block Volume**   | Blocks     | Single VM     | Persistent disk for compute instances |
| **File Storage**   | Files      | Multiple VMs  | Shared workloads, analytics, microservices |
| **Object Storage** | Objects    | Global        | Web/mobile apps, backups, unstructured data |
